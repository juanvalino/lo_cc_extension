I wrote this extension to fulfil a need I had. You're welcome to use it in any way you find useful.

Help is always welcome with development. If you would like to contribute you will need to fork the main repo, make your changes, and send a pull request to have your changes moderated and merged back into the main repo. Details on that process can be found here.
